## keypad-transmitter

This Python code uses the `tkinter` library to create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for a keypad entry system. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

Import the `tkinter` library: from tkinter import * imports all the classes and functions from the tkinter library.

Create the main application window: `root = Tk()` initializes the main tkinter window.

Set the window size and title: `root.geometry("160x180")` sets the window dimensions to 160 pixels in width and 180 pixels in height, and `root.title("key")` sets the window title to "key."

Create a label widget: `abel = Label(text="keypad")` creates a label widget with the text "keypad."

Pack the label widget: `label.pack(padx=10, pady=10)` adds the label widget to the window and adds some padding around it.

Create an entry widget: `e = Entry()` creates an entry widget, which is used for input.

Pack the entry widget: `e.pack()` adds the entry widget to the window.

Define functions for button clicks:
- `btn_click(number)` is a function that updates the entry widget when a number button is clicked.
- `btn_clear()` is a function that clears the contents of the entry widget.
- `btn_submit()` is a function that prints the current contents of the entry widget and clears it.
Create a frame for buttons: `btnframe = Frame()` creates a frame to hold the keypad buttons.

Configure the button frame's column widths: `btnframe.columnconfigure([0,1,2], minsize=40)` configures the three columns within the frame to have a minimum width of 40 pixels.

Create buttons for numbers 1 to 9, a clear button (c), a 0 button, and a send button:
- Each button is created using `Button(btnframe, text="...", command=...)`, with a text label and a command that specifies what function to call when the button is clicked. The lambda functions are used to pass different numbers to the `btn_click` function for numeric buttons.
- Use the grid layout manager to arrange the buttons in a 3x4 grid within the button frame. The sticky option is used to specify how the buttons should expand to fill the available space.

Pack the button frame: `btnframe.pack()` adds the button frame to the main window.

Start the tkinter main event loop: `root.mainloop()` starts the GUI's event loop, allowing the user to interact with the keypad and other widgets.

In summary, this code creates a basic GUI with a numeric keypad that allows users to input numbers and clear the input field. When the "send" button is clicked, it prints the current input value to the console.
